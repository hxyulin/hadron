# Hadron

Hadron is a POSIX compliant, secure, and open-source operating system written in Rust.

It is inspired by the [Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/), but with the constraints of the [SerenityOS](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity) operating system.
This means that everything implemented in the kernel must be written from scratch, with the exception of the rust 'core', and 'alloc' libraries, and other
utility libraries, that are not directly features of a kernel, or tools designed to be used in a kernel. (e.g. `spin`, `bitflags`, `unwinding`, etc.)
This does not include build dependencies (Rust, Make, etc.), or tools to debug and run the kernel (Qemu, GDB, etc.).

## Building

Building Hadron is supported on Linux and macOS.
To build Hadron, you must have the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed.

The build process requires a configuration to be set up. This can be generated by running `make default-config`.
Once the configuration is generated, you can either modify `generated/config.toml` or run `make menuconfig` to configure the build (using a TUI).

To build Hadron, run `make` (use `-j` to split the build into multiple threads).

## Running

To run Hadron, you must have a QEMU emulator installed.
The emulator must be configured to support the x86_64 architecture.

Once the emulator is installed, you can run Hadron by running `make run` (or `cargo run -p hadron`, although this is not recommended).
